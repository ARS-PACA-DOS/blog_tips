# StatnMap blog tips
You'll find here the different R-scripts that I share on my blog articles on <https://statnmap.com>.  
These may be complete scripts or simplified versions to be use directly as templates.

To find the associated blog article, you only have to add the title of folders after <https://statnmap.com/blog/>, like: <https://statnmap.com/blog/translation-of-rmarkdown-documents-using-a-data-frame>
