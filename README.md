# StatnMap blog tips
You'll find here the different R-scripts that I share on my blog articles on <https://statnmap.com>.

To find the associated blog article, you only have to add the title of folders after <https://statnmap.com>, like: <https://statnmap.com/translation-of-rmarkdown-documents-using-a-data-frame>
